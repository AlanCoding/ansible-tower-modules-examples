# ansible-tower-modules-examples
Absurdly meta set of playbooks for use in Ansible Tower to control Ansible Tower

### Local scenario

On my own machine, have tower-cli installed, want to get data into Tower

### Tower scenario

Want to run playbook to create usable data in Tower.
What better way to do this, than to create the data that runs the playbook,
which is creating the data?

![XKCD about being meta](/assets/hofstadter.png?raw=true "XKCD for this")
